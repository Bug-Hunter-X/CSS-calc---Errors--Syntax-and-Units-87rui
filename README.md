# Uncommon CSS Bugs: calc() Errors

This repository demonstrates two common yet subtle errors related to the CSS `calc()` function:

1. **Syntax Errors:** Incorrectly formed expressions within `calc()` can prevent it from working correctly.
2. **Inconsistent Units:** Mixing units (e.g., pixels and percentages) without proper conversion can lead to unexpected results.

The `bug.css` file shows examples of these errors, while `bugSolution.css` provides corrected versions.
