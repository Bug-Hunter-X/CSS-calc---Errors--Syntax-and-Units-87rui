The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, if there is a syntax error in the calculation, it might lead to unexpected results or the property not being applied. For example, missing parentheses or incorrect operators could cause issues.  Another common issue is using units inconsistently within a `calc()` expression. You must use the same unit across all values or ensure proper unit conversion.
